A simple gopher client in vala
==============================

Thank you to Bob131 for teaching me the correct way to do the threading!


## How to make gopher links open in this client

* put the `xdg-open` script in ~/bin
* add ~/bin to PATH such that it overrides your system `xdg-open`
* `export GOPHER=` point to this gopher client
